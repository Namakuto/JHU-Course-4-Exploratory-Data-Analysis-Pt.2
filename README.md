This Markdown report takes in data from the “Stormdata.csv” file from John Hopkins University (JHU). This document sums, and generates barcharts on, the health and economic damages caused by various weather events in the U.S. Events resulting in the highest summed number of human injuries and fatalities, and events resulting in the summed amounts of crop and property damage (in billions of USD dollars), were looked at in this report.

The data is an aggregation of data collected by the National Storm Service from 1950 up until to 2011, in the U.S.
